# Red Team MCP Server Architecture

## Red Team MCP Server Requirements

The Red Team MCP Server must deliver comprehensive offensive security capabilities while maintaining operational security through advanced stealth, resilience, and attack methodologies:

### Core Requirements:
- **Stealth Operations**: Traffic obfuscation, domain fronting, encrypted C2 channels
- **Resilience**: Distributed architecture, automatic failover, data replication
- **Advanced Attacks**: Custom payload delivery, exploitation modules, post-exploitation tools
- **Operational Security**: Anti-forensics, log sanitization, secure communications
- **Scalability**: Multi-target campaign management, resource optimization
- **Legal Compliance**: Audit trails, authorization verification, scope enforcement

## Kali MCP Server Baseline

The existing MCP server provides a solid foundation with:

## Developer Automation Standards

For guidance on configuring GitHub Copilot, Codex, and the associated automation workflows that power the Trading Bot Swarm ecosystem, see [Trading Bot Swarm GitHub Copilot & Codex Configuration Guide](docs/github-copilot-codex-guide.md).

### Current Capabilities:
- **Payload Generation**: Reverse shells (Bash, Python, PowerShell, PHP, etc.)
- **Web Shell Creation**: Multi-language web shells with obfuscation
- **SQLi Payloads**: Database-specific injection vectors
- **XSS Generation**: Cross-site scripting with filter bypasses
- **Privilege Escalation**: Enumeration commands for Linux/Windows
- **Credential Spraying**: Service-specific brute force frameworks

### Architecture Strengths:
- Modular tool design with FastMCP framework
- Pydantic input validation for security
- Multi-format output support (Markdown/JSON)
- Comprehensive payload obfuscation methods

## Design Enhancement 1: Stealth and Obfuscation

### Traffic Shaping and Protocol Obfuscation
- **Domain Fronting**: Route C2 traffic through legitimate CDN endpoints
- **Protocol Mimicry**: Disguise malicious traffic as HTTPS, DNS, or other protocols
- **Traffic Randomization**: Variable timing, packet sizes, and communication patterns
- **Encrypted Channels**: End-to-end encryption with custom key exchange

### Implementation Details and Security Considerations for Enhancement 1

**Traffic Obfuscation Layer:**
- Implement domain fronting using major CDNs (CloudFlare, AWS CloudFront)
- Use DNS-over-HTTPS tunneling for covert channel establishment
- Deploy custom TLS fingerprinting to mimic legitimate applications
- Integrate jitter and sleep randomization to avoid pattern detection

**Security Considerations:**
- Regularly rotate domain fronts and infrastructure
- Implement certificate pinning bypass techniques
- Monitor for DNS sinkholing and traffic inspection
- Use ephemeral encryption keys with perfect forward secrecy
