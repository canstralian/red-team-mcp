# Defensive Evasion Matrix

**Status:** ✅ OPERATIONAL
**Purpose:** Map attack techniques to defensive controls and calculate residual risk
**Framework:** MITRE ATT&CK-aligned
**Use Case:** Defensive security posture assessment and gap analysis

---

## Overview

The Defensive Evasion Matrix provides a comprehensive mapping between offensive techniques (present in the red-team-mcp toolkit) and defensive counter-controls. It calculates residual risk after applying controls and identifies high-priority security gaps.

### Key Capabilities

- **16 MITRE ATT&CK Techniques Mapped** across 8 tactics
- **20 Defensive Controls** with effectiveness ratings
- **Residual Risk Calculation** using Likelihood × Impact × (1 - Control Effectiveness)
- **Gap Prioritization** to focus defensive investments
- **Multi-Dimensional Analysis** by platform, tactic, or technique
- **CSV Export** for spreadsheet analysis
- **REST API** for integration with security tools

## Risk Calculation Methodology

### Formula

```
Inherent Risk = Likelihood × Impact

Residual Risk = Inherent Risk × (1 - Combined Control Effectiveness)

where:
Combined Effectiveness = 1 - ∏(1 - Effectiveness_i)  for all controls
```

### Risk Levels

| Score (0-10) | Level | Action Required |
|--------------|-------|-----------------|
| 9.0 - 10.0 | CRITICAL | Implement controls immediately |
| 7.0 - 8.9  | HIGH | Add compensating controls (priority) |
| 4.0 - 6.9  | MEDIUM | Add detective controls (recommended) |
| 1.0 - 3.9  | LOW | Monitor and verify effectiveness |
| 0.0 - 0.9  | MINIMAL | Current controls sufficient |

### Example Calculation

**Technique:** T1059.001 (PowerShell)
**Base Likelihood:** 0.7 (adjusted by detection difficulty)
**Base Impact:** 0.8
**Inherent Risk:** 0.7 × 0.8 = 0.56

**Controls Applied:**
- CTRL-001 (Script Block Logging): 80% effective
- CTRL-002 (Constrained Language Mode): 80% effective

**Combined Effectiveness:**
1 - (1 - 0.8) × (1 - 0.8) = 1 - (0.2 × 0.2) = 1 - 0.04 = 0.96

**Residual Risk:**
0.56 × (1 - 0.96) = 0.56 × 0.04 = 0.0224

**Risk Score:** 0.0224 × 10 = 0.224 → **MINIMAL**

## Defensive Playbooks

### Scenario 1: High Residual Risk on C2 Techniques

**Finding:** T1090.004 (Domain Fronting) shows HIGH residual risk (0.72)

**Current Controls:**
- CTRL-004: Egress Firewall (80% effective)
- CTRL-015: TLS Inspection (55% effective)

**Gap:** Only 2 controls, both with implementation challenges

**Recommended Actions:**
1. **Immediate:** Enhance TLS inspection coverage (increase from 55% to 80%)
2. **Short-term:** Deploy DNS-based C2 detection (CTRL-016)
3. **Medium-term:** Implement network traffic baselining (CTRL-017)
4. **Long-term:** Deploy AI-based anomaly detection for encrypted traffic

**Expected Outcome:** Residual risk reduced from 0.72 (HIGH) to 0.12 (LOW)

### Scenario 2: Missing Detective Controls

**Finding:** T1505.003 (Web Shell) has only preventive controls

**Current Controls:**
- CTRL-005: File Integrity Monitoring (80% effective)

**Gap:** No detective controls for runtime detection

**Recommended Actions:**
1. **Immediate:** Deploy EDR with web shell YARA rules (CTRL-019)
2. **Short-term:** Enable web server access log monitoring
3. **Medium-term:** Implement behavioral analysis for web processes

**Expected Outcome:** Defense-in-depth with both prevention and detection

### Scenario 3: Platform-Specific Hardening

**Finding:** Linux platform has lower control coverage than Windows

**Gap Analysis:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/defense/matrix/by-platform/linux
```

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Deploy auditd with comprehensive rules (CTRL-003)
2. Implement SUID binary monitoring (CTRL-013)
3. Enable SELinux/AppArmor mandatory access controls
4. Deploy EDR with Linux-specific detections

## Integration Points

### SIEM Integration

Export matrix to CSV and import into Splunk/ELK for correlation:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/defense/matrix/export/csv | \
  splunk import csv -index security
```

### SOAR Playbooks

Use API to trigger automated responses:

```python
import requests

# Check for critical gaps
response = requests.get("http://localhost:8000/defense/matrix/gaps")
gaps = response.json()["priority_gaps"]

for gap in gaps:
    if gap["risk_level"] in ["critical", "high"]:
        # Trigger SOAR playbook
        trigger_response_playbook(gap["technique_id"])
```

### Threat Intelligence

Map IOCs to techniques and assess defensive readiness:

```python
# IOC detected: PowerShell encoded command
technique = "T1059.001"

# Check defensive posture
mapping = analyzer.analyze_technique(technique)
if mapping.risk_level() in [RiskLevel.HIGH, RiskLevel.CRITICAL]:
    alert_security_team(f"High-risk technique {technique} detected with insufficient controls")
```

---

## Maintenance

### Updating Techniques

Add new techniques to `app/defense/technique_database.py`:

```python
"T1234.567": AttackTechnique(
    technique_id="T1234.567",
    technique_name="New Technique",
    tactic=TechniqueCategory.EXECUTION,
    description="Description here",
    platform=["linux", "windows"],
    data_sources=["Process monitoring"],
    detection_difficulty=RiskLevel.MEDIUM
)
```

### Adding Controls

Add new controls to `app/defense/control_database.py`:

```python
"CTRL-021": DefensiveControl(
    control_id="CTRL-021",
    control_name="New Control",
    control_type="preventive",
    description="Control description",
    implementation_cost=RiskLevel.MEDIUM,
    effectiveness=ControlEffectiveness.SUBSTANTIAL,
    coverage=["T1234.567"],
    detection_methods=["Method 1", "Method 2"],
    response_actions=["Action 1", "Action 2"]
)
```
